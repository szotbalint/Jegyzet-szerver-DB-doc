Before starting it is necessary to install the following plugins\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-user}{\texttt{ Rain\+Lab.\+User}}
\item \href{https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-location}{\texttt{ Rain\+Lab.\+Location}}
\item \href{https://octobercms.com/plugin/responsiv-currency}{\texttt{ Responsiv.\+Currency}}
\item \href{https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-pages}{\texttt{ Rain\+Lab.\+Pages (Recomendable)}}
\item \href{https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-translate}{\texttt{ Rain\+Lab.\+Translate (Recomendable)}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Then we will begin to integrate the components to our current theme.

The integration of this plugin is very simple and we can finish it in a few steps. You can also download a sample theme from \href{http://demos.pixel.hn/october-plugins/shop/demo.zip}{\texttt{ here}}\hypertarget{md_pixel_shop_setup_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysection{First Step}\label{md_pixel_shop_setup_autotoc_md22}
We make sure that in the layout we use always contain within the $<$/ head$>$ tag the twig tag {\ttfamily \{\% styles\%\}}, and before closing the $<$body $>$ tag the twig tags {\ttfamily \{\% framework extras\%\}} and {\ttfamily \{\% scripts \%\}}.

… $<$head$>$ … \{\% styles \%\} $<$/head$>$ $<$body$>$ … \{\% framework extras \%\} \{\% scripts \%\} $<$body$>$

Next we will integrate the {\ttfamily Cart Button} component in any part of the layout, this will help us to keep the button always present in any page of the site. We can also configure it to our liking, being able to change the text and background color of the botton.

\hypertarget{md_pixel_shop_setup_autotoc_md23}{}\doxysection{Second Step}\label{md_pixel_shop_setup_autotoc_md23}
We will create the following pages with their respective routes including the following components\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily /profile} \+: Account
\item {\ttfamily /cart/\+:step?} \+: Cart
\item {\ttfamily /products/\+:category?} \+: Products
\item {\ttfamily /product/\+:slug} \+: Product Detail
\end{DoxyItemize}

You can include the component inside a div container for better control.

The names of the routes are optional and can vary according to your taste but what can not vary are the names of the parameters of the routes (eg ... /\+: step?)

We make sure that all the configurations of each component are correct. We have to take into account to link each component with its respective page. Below is an example of the default settings of each component\+:\hypertarget{md_pixel_shop_setup_autotoc_md24}{}\doxyparagraph{Account Component}\label{md_pixel_shop_setup_autotoc_md24}
