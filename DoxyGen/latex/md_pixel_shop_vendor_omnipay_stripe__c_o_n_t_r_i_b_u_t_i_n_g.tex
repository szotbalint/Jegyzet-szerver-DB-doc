\item Add tests for it. This is important so I don\textquotesingle{}t break it in a future version unintentionally.
\item Commit just the modifications, do not mess with the composer.\+json or CHANGELOG.\+md files.
\item Ensure your code is nicely formatted in the \href{https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md}{\texttt{ PSR-\/2}} style and that all tests pass.
