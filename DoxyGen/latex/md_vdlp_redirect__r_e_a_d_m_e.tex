All redirects are stored in the database and will be automatically \char`\"{}published\char`\"{} to a file which the internal redirect mechanism uses to determine if a certain request needs to be redirected. This is way faster than querying a database.

This plugin is designed to be fast and should have no negative effect on the performance of your website.

To gain maximum performance with this plugin\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Enable redirect caching using a \char`\"{}in-\/memory\char`\"{} caching method (see Caching).
\item Maintain your redirects frequently to keep the number of redirects as low as possible.
\item Try to use placeholders to keep your number of redirect low (less redirects is better performance).
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_vdlp_redirect__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md724}{}\doxysubsection{Caching}\label{md_vdlp_redirect__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md724}
If your website has a lot of redirects it is recommended to enable redirect caching. You can enable redirect caching in the settings panel of this plugin.

Only cache drivers which support tagged cache are supported. So driver {\ttfamily file} and {\ttfamily database} are not supported. For this plugin database and file caching do not increase performance, but can actually have a negative influence on performance. So it is recommended to use an in-\/memory caching solution like {\ttfamily memcached} or {\ttfamily redis}.\hypertarget{md_vdlp_redirect__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md725}{}\doxysubsubsection{How caching works}\label{md_vdlp_redirect__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md725}
If caching is enabled (and supported) every request which is handled by this plugin will be cached. It will be stored with tag {\ttfamily Vdlp.\+Redirect}.

When you modify a redirect all redirect cache will be invalidated automatically. It is also possible to manually clear the cache using the \textquotesingle{}Clear cache\textquotesingle{} button in the Backend.\hypertarget{md_vdlp_redirect__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md726}{}\doxysubsection{Placeholders}\label{md_vdlp_redirect__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md726}
This plugin makes advantage of the {\ttfamily symfony/routing} package.
